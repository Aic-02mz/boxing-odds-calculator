# Boxing Odds Calculator

## Description

The **Boxing Odds Calculator** is a Python-based command-line tool that helps users convert between decimal and fractional betting odds for boxing matches and calculates implied probability based on the given odds. This program was inspired by the functionality of the AceOdds Odds Converter and provides a basic, non-GUI interface for working with odds.
